# Avrio Explorer
This is a client side based DAG explorer for avrio. Make sure you are running a copy of [Avrio Indexer](https://github.com/avrio-project/avrio-indexer/) which has its port opened
Edit the file in src/js/config.js to point to your instance of avrio indexer (or use the public one at http://5.189.172.54:1234)
Place everything inside your web hosting folder (eg /var/www/html)
